        Hi there! First of all, thank you for being here! My name is Julio and
        originally I am from Granada, Spain. I came to KrakÃ³w some years ago,
        where I have lived and worked happily since.
        <br />A couple of words about my professional life: I started my way
        into IT as an IT Operations Analyst working for HCL Poland and Stanley
        Black and Decker Polska. For personal reasons I moved back to KrakÃ³w
        where I got a job as a Cloud Engineer for Capgemini Polska on the
        Microsoft Team.
        <br />
        In late 2018 I grew a love for web development. It started all of a
        sudden and since then, I knew that there was no turning back. I felt
        addicted to coding. I love it, every part of it, because it is amazingly
        challenging and fun.
        <br />
        In September 2019, Schibsted Tech Polska gave me the opportunity to work
        a full time job as a{' '}
        <span className="special">FullStack Javascript Developer</span>{' '}
        <span role="img" aria-label="tada">
          ðŸŽ‰
        </span>{' '}
        It really has been a dream come true. And now I am lucky enough to
        everyday being able to work around TypeScript, React and Nodejs among
        other things.
