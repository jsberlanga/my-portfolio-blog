I love Redis but somehow it's never my first go to choice when storing data.
Embracing Redis is a mindset change. We are used to think of storing data as a
way of storing large amounts of data, but more times than often, you just need
to store some plain json objects.

In this post I'll show you how I halve the time of a query, changing from
storing the data on a non-sql database, MongoDB to Redis.

#### a quick unorthodox comparison

Before jumping into the specifics and the whatnots behind it, let's do an old
school comparison and just measure how long does it take for a bunch of requests
to respond

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      10 requests to the mongoDB endpoint took some <b>7.3s</b> 👇🏻
    </p>

      layout="responsive"
      width={923}
      height={920}
      alt="performance mongodb endpoint"
    />
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Whereas the same 10 requests to the redis endpoint took some <b>5.7s</b>{' '}
      👇🏻
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkj0lviac/image/upload/v1616937848/ab-redis.jpg"
      layout="responsive"
      width={856}
      height={920}
      alt="performance redis endpoint"
    />
  </li>
</ul>

That right there my friend, it's an average <b>difference of 160ms</b> per
request.
